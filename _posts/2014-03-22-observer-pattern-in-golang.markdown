For some reason at some point, I thought it would be hard to implement the observer pattern in Go. Then I made an issue for me to blog about it. Well it's not hard. It's as easy as it is in every 
other language.

# Observers

First part of the observer pattern is you need the actual observers. The logic that you want executed whenever something happens. Here I've just put a simple log print statement that will print out the name of the hook to the log. 

Created an interface to allow for more flexible typing later on.

```go
type TestCallBack struct {
  
}

func (c *TestCallBack) Exec(o *Observable) {
  log.Println(o.Name)
}

type Callback interface {
	Exec(h *Observable)
}
```

# Observer Notifier

The main part of the logic, simply have an add observer and then have a process function that loops through and calls them all.

```go
type Observer struct {
	callbacks []Callback
}
 
func (o *Observer) Add(c Callback) {
	o.callbacks = append(o.callbacks, c)
}
 
func (o *Observer) Process(oe *Observable) {
	for _, c := range o.callbacks {
		c.Exec(oe)
	}
}
```

# Full

Here is a copy of it all together. As you can see it's really simple to whack together once you have a half decent understanding of Go.

```go
type Observer struct {
	callbacks []Callback
}
 
func (o *Observer) Add(c Callback) {
	o.callbacks = append(o.callbacks, c)
}
 
func (o *Observer) Process(oe *Observable) {
	for _, c := range o.callbacks {
		c.Exec(oe)
	}
}
```
