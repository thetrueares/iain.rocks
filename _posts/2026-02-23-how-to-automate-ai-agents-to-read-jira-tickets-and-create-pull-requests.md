title: "How to automate AI agents to read JIRA tickets and create pull requests"
date: "2026-02-23 12:50:40 +0200"
categories: ["AI"]
author: Iain Cambridge
---
During my exploration of AI and code generation I created a series of guidelines for the 
AI agent to follow to allow me to automate as much of the process as possible. Here I 
will share a view of my guideline files that I've created. I have them separated to allow 
me to be able to have the agent do stuff while not doing all of the things I usually done,
normally when I'm experimenting or trying to fix something when the agent messes up and I
stop it half way through.

These have been tested on Junie, Claude, and Gemini. Using using these files you're able to do the follow:

`Please work on ticket DEVHELM-144`.


## Git Usage

I wanted to be able to have my agents automatically commit stuff and create pull requests
so I could code review the code using my standard approach and tooling instead of monitoring
the agent and doing it in a way that I found more work.

```
Git Usage
=========

This document provides a quick reference for common Git commands and workflows.

# Branching and Merging

This flow must exist

Basic Flow for a feature is as follows:

* Switch to the main branch `main` then
* Pull the latest changes from the main branch with `git pull --rebase origin main`.
* Create a new branch from main for your feature with the name of the branch based on the feature you are working on.
* Make changes to the code.
* Stage the changes with `git add .` or `git add <specific files>`.
* Commit the changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "Your message here"
* Push the changes to the remote repository with `git push origin <branch-name>`
* Create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch if one doesn't exist

# Git Commit Requirements

When committing changes, ensure that:

* YOU MUST If there are PHP changes, run `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --allow-unsupported-php-version=yes` to ensure the code style is correct
* The commit message MUST start with a prefix for the JIRA ticket if there is one if not DH-NIL
* The commit message is clear and descriptive.

# Pull Requests

You only create pull requests for new tasks. When handling code review for existing pull requests, you do not create new pull requests. Instead, you update the existing pull request by pushing additional commits to the same branch that the pull request was created from.

## Updating Existing Pull Requests

* YOU MUST SWTICH TO THE FEATURE BRANCH WITH `git checkout feature/DH-3-a-feature` BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES TO AN EXISTING PULL REQUEST.
* YOU MUST PULL THE LATEST CHANGES FROM THE FEATURE BRANCH WITH `git pull --rebase origin feature/DH-3-a-feature` BEFORE PUSHING ANY NEW COMMITS TO AN EXISTING PULL REQUEST.
* Make any necessary changes or additions to the code.
* Stage the changes with `git add .` or `git add <specific files>`.
* Commit the changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "Your message here"
* Push the changes to the remote repository with `git push origin <branch-name>`
* The existing pull request will automatically update with the new commits
* You will check the status of the build with a 1 minute pause inbetween checks and address any issues that arise

## Create Pull Requests

When creating a pull request, follow these guidelines:

* It should include a clear title and description of the changes made.
* It should reference the JIRA ticket if applicable.
* It should be assigned to the appropriate reviewer (that-guy-iain).
* It should be linked to the relevant JIRA ticket.
* If there is already a pull request for the same branch, you should not create a new one. Instead, update the existing pull request with your changes.
* There should only be one pull request per JIRA ticket.
* * You will check the status of the build with a 1 minute pause inbetween checks and address any issues that arise
```

## JIRA Usage

I use JIRA a lot, especially at work, so I wanted my agents to be told to do a ticket and it'll then fetch everything from confluence and other files.

```
JIRA Usage
==========

This document provides a quick reference for how we use JIRA.

You will find the identity of the lead developer making the request in the file located at `~/agent_info.txt`.

## Project

The JIRA for this project is DevHelm. The project key is DH.

## Ticket Research

When you are told to work on a ticket, you should first research the ticket to understand what it is about. This includes:

* YOU MUST Assign the ticket to the lead developer  making the request so they can keep track of it if it is not already assigned.
* Reading the ticket description.
* The label for the ticket is important; it will tell you what type of ticket it is. For example, if the label is "web" then then the work belongs to the web project. If the label is "mcp" then the work belongs to the MCP project. If the label is "agent" then the work belongs to the agent project.
* Checking the comments for any additional context or updates.
* Reviewing any attachments or linked issues for relevant information.
* Understanding the acceptance criteria and any dependencies.
* Reading the ticket history to see how it has evolved.
* Reading any related Confluence pages or documentation that may provide additional context.
* If there are scenarios/features Gherkin in the ticket description that is to be used as a feature file and pass

## New Task

* YOU MUST MOVE THE TICKET TO "IN PROGRESS".
* YOU MUST COMMENT WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED WORKING ON THE TICKET IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE TICKET WITH A LINK TO THE PULL REQUEST AND MOVE THE TICKET TO "IN REVIEW".


## Code Review

* YOU MUST COMMENT WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED WORKING ON THE TICKET IN THE COMMENT SECTION OF THE TICKET WITH A LINK TO THE PULL REQUEST AND MOVE THE TICKET TO "IN REVIEW"
```

## DevHelm 

Here are the DevHelm guidelines, for a Symfony application. This ensures it follows the Symfony standards I want. But more importantly it'll create a feature file based on any Gerkhin
is found within the JIRA ticket.

TL;NR - You can get it at (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevHelm/DevHelm/refs/heads/main/.junie/web/guidelines.md([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevHelm/DevHelm/refs/heads/main/.junie/web/guidelines.md])

```
# DevHelm Web Development Guidelines

This document provides essential information for developing the ComControl web application, a Symfony 7.2 + Vue.js 3 project with comprehensive testing setup.

## Project Architecture

The web application is built using:
- **Backend**: Symfony 7.2 with PHP 8.2+
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Webpack Encore
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS optimization
- **Build System**: Webpack Encore with Babel for transpilation

## Build and Configuration

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Composer

### Initial Setup
\`\`\`bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install

# Copy configuration files (if needed)
cp .env.example .env
cp phpunit.dist.xml phpunit.xml
cp behat.yml.dist behat.yml
\`\`\`

### Build Commands

#### Development
\`\`\`bash
# Start the docker environment
docker compose up -d 

# Build assets for development
npm run dev

# Build assets and watch for changes
npm run watch

# Start development server with HMR
npm run dev-server
\`\`\`

#### Production
\`\`\`bash
# Build optimized assets for production
npm run build
\`\`\`

### Webpack Configuration

The `webpack.config.js` uses Symfony Encore with:
- Vue.js loader enabled
- Sass/SCSS support
- Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS for production optimization
- Source maps in development
- Asset versioning in production

**Important Note**: There's a syntax error in `webpack.config.js` line 33: `pluginsplugins` should be `plugins`.

### Asset Structure
- Entry point: `./assets/app.js`
- Output directory: `public/build/`
- Templates scanned for PurgeCSS: `./templates/**/*.twig`, `./assets/js/**/*.vue`, `./assets/js/**/*.js`

## Testing Framework

The project uses multiple testing frameworks for comprehensive coverage:

### JavaScript Testing (Jest)

#### Configuration
- Config file: `jest.config.js` (minimal configuration with v8 coverage provider)
- Test files location: `assets/services/__tests__/`
- Pattern: `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`

#### Running JavaScript Tests
\`\`\`bash
# Run all JavaScript tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- assets/services/__tests__/example.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
\`\`\`

#### Example Test Structure
\`\`\`javascript
describe('Test Suite Name', () => {
    test('test description', () => {
        expect(actual).toBe(expected);
    });
});
\`\`\`

**Important**: Existing tests use Vitest imports but Jest is configured as the test runner. Use Jest syntax for new tests.

### PHP Unit Testing (PHPUnit)

#### Configuration
- Config file: `phpunit.dist.xml`
- Test directory: `tests/`
- Bootstrap: `tests/bootstrap.php`
- Environment: `APP_ENV=test`

#### Running PHP Tests
\`\`\`bash
# Start the docker environment
docker compose up -d 

# Run all unit tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php

# Run tests with coverage
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/
\`\`\`

#### Test Structure
\`\`\`php
<?php

namespace App\Tests\Unit;

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testExample(): void
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
        $this->assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### BDD Testing (Behat)

#### Configuration
- Config file: `behat.yml.dist`
- Features directory: `features/`
- Context classes in: `App\Tests\Behat\`

#### Available Contexts
- `DemoContext`
- `GeneralContext` 
- `UserContext`
- `PlanContext`
- `TeamContext`

#### Running Behat Tests

\`\`\`bash
# Start up docker
docker compose up -d

# Run all BDD tests
docker compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/behat

# Dry run to check syntax
docker compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/behat --dry-run

# Run specific feature
docker compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/behat features/demo.feature
\`\`\`

## Code Quality

### PHP CS Fixer
The project uses PHP CS Fixer for code style enforcement:

\`\`\`bash
# Fix code style (as per git guidelines)
docker compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --allow-unsupported-php-version=yes
\`\`\`

### PHP Code Standards

* **Use Attributes Over Annotations**: Always prefer PHP 8 attributes over docblock annotations:
    - ✅ DO: `#[Route('/api/users', name: 'api_users')]`
    - ❌ DON'T: `@Route("/api/users", name="api_users")`
    - ✅ DO: `#[Assert\NotBlank]`
    - ❌ DON'T: `@Assert\NotBlank`

  Attributes are natively supported in PHP 8+, provide better type safety, better IDE support, and are part of the language syntax rather than comments.

### Testing Guidelines

1. **JavaScript Tests**: Place in `assets/services/__tests__/` with `.test.js` extension
2. **PHP Unit Tests**: Place in `tests/Unit/` with `Test.php` suffix
3. **Integration Tests**: Use `tests/Integration/` directory
4. **BDD Tests**: Create `.feature` files in `features/` directory
5. **Do Not Test Logic-less Classes**: Do not write tests for entities, DTOs, and other classes that contain no logic. These classes typically only define properties and getters/setters without business logic, making tests redundant and maintenance-heavy. Focus testing efforts on classes that contain actual business logic.

## Architecture
### Value Objects and Enums

* Value Objects and Enums are held within the namespace that they belong to within the purposes of the domain. For example, a Money Value Object would be in the App\Entity namespace as it is used by entities. And an enum representing the status of a Subscription would be in the DevHelm\Subscription namespace.

### Repositories

* The repository pattern that is used throughout this project is documented in repository-pattern.md
* DOCTRINE MUST NOT BE USED OUTSIDE OF THE `App\Repository` NAMESPACE
* When querying entities that only need data from a single entity, use the `findOneBy` and `findBy` methods instead of QueryBuilder. QueryBuilder should only be used for complex queries involving multiple tables/entities.

### DTOs

* The DTOS are held within the App\Dto namespace. They are readonly classes that use the constructor promotion and only contain public members.
* DTOs are organised by endpoint type api, app, and webhook which is decided based on the route of the controller action. And then organised further into Request and Response based upon if they are used to represent the request body or response body. Webhooks may not have a DTO for all endpoints, but API and APP MUST have DTOs for their Request and Response.
* DTOs are to use the Symfony Serializer component. And members are to be snake_case and not camelCase.
* Response DTOs are to be created within the Factory relating to that domain item.
* And Generic will be things such as ListResponse.

Structure:

|- Generic
|- Api
|   | - Request
|   | - Response
|- App
|   | - Request
|   | - Response


### Controllers

* Controllers are organised by endpoint type api, app, and webhook, which is decided based on the route of the controller action.
* Controllers *MUST NOT* use doctrine EntityManager directly and MUST use a repository interface. Dependencies should be injected into the action and not the constructor.
* Controllers are to use the Symfony Serializer component to deserialize request bodies into DTOs and serialize response DTOs into JSON.
* Controllers are to use the Symfony Validator component to validate request DTOs.
* Controllers are to use the Parthenon LoggerTrait for logging.
* Controllers should have dependencies injected into the action method rather than the constructor.
* Controllers MUST log the receipt of requests and key actions taken, including any errors encountered.
* Controllers MUST not be unit tested but tested via functional tests or Behat.

#### File and Class Organization Requirements

* **Single Class Per File**: PHP files MUST contain only a single class. Multiple classes in one file are not permitted:
    - ✅ DO: One controller class per file
    - ❌ DON'T: Multiple controller classes in the same file

* **Controller Action Grouping**: All controller actions for a single entity/domain MUST be grouped into a single controller class:
    - ✅ DO: All agent-related actions (create, list, update, delete) in `AgentController`
    - ❌ DON'T: Separate controller classes for different routes of the same entity (e.g., `AgentController` and `AgentSingleController`)

#### Controller-Specific Logging and User Injection Guidelines

* **Logger Usage with LoggerAwareTrait**: When using `LoggerAwareTrait`, do NOT inject `LoggerInterface` into controller actions. Instead, access the logger via `$this->getLogger()`:
    - ✅ DO: `$this->getLogger()->info('Message');`
    - ❌ DON'T: Inject `LoggerInterface $logger` and use `$this->setLogger($logger);`

* **User Injection**: Always inject the current user using the `#[CurrentUser]` attribute, not by manually retrieving from request attributes:
    - ✅ DO: `#[CurrentUser] User $user` in action parameter
    - ❌ DON'T: `$user = $request->attributes->get('_user');`

* **Team Access**: Do not add unnecessary sanity checks for user team relationships. If the user is authenticated and authorized, assume valid team relationships exist:
    - ✅ DO: `$team = $user->getTeam();` (direct access)
    - ❌ DON'T: `if (!$team instanceof Team) { return new JsonResponse(['error' => 'User must belong to a team'], Response::HTTP_FORBIDDEN); }`

**Structure:**

|- Api
|- App
|- Webhooks


### CRUD Actions

**Create:**
\`\`\`php
    #[IsGranted('ROLE_LEAD')]
    #[Route('/app/product/{id}/price', name: 'app_product_price_create', methods: ['POST'])]
    public function createPrice(
        Request $request,
        SerializerInterface $serializer,
        ValidatorInterface $validator,
        PriceRepositoryInterface $priceRepository,
        ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository,
        PriceFactory $priceFactory,
    ) {
        $this->getLogger()->info('Received request to create price', ['product_id' => $request->get('id')]);

        try {
            /** @var Product $product */
            $product = $productRepository->getById($request->get('id'));
        } catch (NoEntityFoundException $e) {
            return new JsonResponse([], JsonResponse::HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
        }

        /** @var CreatePrice $dto */
        $dto = $serializer->deserialize($request->getContent(), CreatePrice::class, 'json');
        $errors = $validator->validate($dto);

        if (count($errors) > 0) {
            $errorOutput = [];
            foreach ($errors as $error) {
                $propertyPath = $error->getPropertyPath();
                $errorOutput[$propertyPath] = $error->getMessage();
            }

            return new JsonResponse([
                'errors' => $errorOutput,
            ], JsonResponse::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);
        }

        $price = $priceFactory->createPriceFromDto($dto);
        $price->setProduct($product);

        $priceRepository->save($price);
        $dto = $priceFactory->createAppDto($price);
        $jsonResponse = $serializer->serialize($dto, 'json');

        return new JsonResponse($jsonResponse, JsonResponse::HTTP_CREATED, json: true);
    }
\`\`\`

**List:**

All CRUD list pages MUST follow this pattern using the CrudRepositoryInterface getList method with proper pagination and filtering:

\`\`\`php
    #[Route('/app/price', name: 'app_price_list', methods: ['GET'])]
    public function listPrices(
        Request $request,
        PriceRepositoryInterface $priceRepository,
        SerializerInterface $serializer,
        PriceDataMapper $priceFactory,
    ): Response {
        $this->getLogger()->info('Received request to list prices');

        $lastKey = $request->get('last_key');
        $firstKey = $request->get('first_key');
        $resultsPerPage = (int) $request->get('limit', 10);

        if ($resultsPerPage < 1) {
            return new JsonResponse([
                'reason' => 'limit is below 1',
            ], JsonResponse::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);
        }

        if ($resultsPerPage > 100) {
            return new JsonResponse([
                'reason' => 'limit is above 100',
            ], JsonResponse::HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE);
        }

        // Add filters based on business logic (e.g., team filtering, user access, etc.)
        $filters = [
            // Example: 'team' => $user->getTeam()->getId(),
        ];

        $resultSet = $priceRepository->getList(
            filters: $filters,
            limit: $resultsPerPage,
            lastId: $lastKey,
            firstId: $firstKey,
            sortKey: 'id', // or relevant sorting field
            sortType: 'DESC',
        );

        $dtos = array_map([$priceFactory, 'createAppDto'], $resultSet->getResults());

        $listResponse = new ListResponse();
        $listResponse->setHasMore($resultSet->hasMore());
        $listResponse->setData($dtos);
        $listResponse->setLastKey($resultSet->getLastKey());

        $json = $serializer->serialize($listResponse, 'json');

        return new JsonResponse($json, json: true);
    }
\`\`\`

**Key Requirements for CRUD List Pattern:**
- MUST use CrudRepositoryInterface getList method with all parameters
- MUST include pagination validation (limit 1-100)
- MUST include proper filtering based on user context
- MUST use firstId, lastId, sortKey, and sortType parameters
- MUST return proper ListResponse with hasMore and lastKey

**Update:**

\`\`\`php
    #[IsGranted('ROLE_LEAD')]
    #[Route('/app/product/{id}/price/{priceId}/delete', name: 'app_product_price_delete', methods: ['POST'])]
    public function deletePrice(
        Request $request,
        PriceRepositoryInterface $priceRepository,
    ) {
        $this->getLogger()->info('Received request to delete price', ['product_id' => $request->get('id'), 'price_id' => $request->get('priceId')]);

        try {
            /** @var Price $price */
            $price = $priceRepository->findById($request->get('priceId'));
        } catch (NoEntityFoundException $exception) {
            return new JsonResponse([], JsonResponse::HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
        }

        $price->markAsDeleted();
        $priceRepository->save($price);

        return new JsonResponse([], JsonResponse::HTTP_ACCEPTED);
    }
\`\`\`

**Delete**
\`\`\`php
    #[IsGranted('ROLE_LEAD')]
    #[Route('/app/product/{id}/price/{priceId}/delete', name: 'app_product_price_delete', methods: ['POST'])]
    public function deletePrice(
        Request $request,
        PriceRepositoryInterface $priceRepository,
    ) {
        $this->getLogger()->info('Received request to delete price', ['product_id' => $request->get('id'), 'price_id' => $request->get('priceId')]);

        try {
            /** @var Price $price */
            $price = $priceRepository->findById($request->get('priceId'));
        } catch (NoEntityFoundException $exception) {
            return new JsonResponse([], JsonResponse::HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
        }

        $price->markAsDeleted();
        $priceRepository->save($price);

        return new JsonResponse([], JsonResponse::HTTP_ACCEPTED);
    }
\`\`\`

**Edit:**

\`\`\`php
 #[IsGranted('ROLE_LEAD')]
    #[Route('/app/product/{id}/update', name: 'app_product_update_view', methods: ['GET'])]
    public function viewUpdateProduct(
        Request $request,
        ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository,
        ProductDataMapper $dataMapper,
        TaxTypeRepositoryInterface $taxTypeRepository,
        TaxTypeDataMapper $taxTypeDataMapper,
        SerializerInterface $serializer,
    ): Response {
        $this->getLogger()->info('Received request to read update products', ['product_id' => $request->get('id')]);

        try {
            $product = $productRepository->getById($request->get('id'));
        } catch (NoEntityFoundException $exception) {
            return new JsonResponse(['success' => false], JsonResponse::HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
        }

        $taxTypes = $taxTypeRepository->getAll();
        $taxTypeDtos = array_map([$taxTypeDataMapper, 'createAppDto'], $taxTypes);
        $view = new UpdateProductView();
        $view->setProduct($dataMapper->createAppDtoFromProduct($product));
        $view->setTaxTypes($taxTypeDtos);

        $json = $serializer->serialize($view, 'json');

        return new JsonResponse($json, json: true);
    }

    #[IsGranted('ROLE_LEAD')]
    #[Route('/app/product/{id}', name: 'app_product_update', methods: ['POST'])]
    public function updateProduct(
        Request $request,
        ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository,
        SerializerInterface $serializer,
        ValidatorInterface $validator,
        ProductDataMapper $productFactory,
    ): Response {
        $this->getLogger()->info('Received request to write update products', ['product_id' => $request->get('id')]);

        try {
            /** @var Product $product */
            $product = $productRepository->getById($request->get('id'));
        } catch (NoEntityFoundException $e) {
            return new JsonResponse([], JsonResponse::HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
        }

        /** @var CreateProduct $dto */
        $dto = $serializer->deserialize($request->getContent(), CreateProduct::class, 'json');
        $errors = $validator->validate($dto);

        if (count($errors) > 0) {
            $errorOutput = [];
            foreach ($errors as $error) {
                $propertyPath = $error->getPropertyPath();
                $errorOutput[$propertyPath] = $error->getMessage();
            }

            return new JsonResponse([
                'errors' => $errorOutput,
            ], JsonResponse::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);
        }

        $newProduct = $productFactory->createFromAppCreate($dto, $product);

        $productRepository->save($newProduct);
        $dto = $productFactory->createAppDtoFromProduct($newProduct);
        $jsonResponse = $serializer->serialize($dto, 'json');

        return new JsonResponse($jsonResponse, JsonResponse::HTTP_ACCEPTED, json: true);
    }
\`\`\`

### Frontend

* Within the Frontend, submit buttons should use the Parthenon SubmitButton component.
* When loading pages or changing views, it should use LoadingScreen component.
* THERE SHOULD NEVER BE RAW STRINGS IN THE TEMPLATE. EVERYTHING *MUST* BE A LOCALISATION ID
* Translations should be in British English, American English, and German
* CSS should use tailwind utils

## Comments

* All classes and methods should only have doc blocks if not type hinted.
* Inline comments should only be used for very complex logic. Almost never.

## Committing

* To ensure that the code style is correct YOU MUST run `web/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --allow-unsupported-php-version=yes` before committing any PHP changes.

## Development Workflow

### Creating New Tests

#### JavaScript Test Example
\`\`\`javascript
// assets/services/__tests__/myservice.test.js
describe('MyService', () => {
    test('should perform expected operation', () => {
        // Test implementation
        expect(result).toBe(expected);
    });
});
\`\`\`

#### PHP Test Example
\`\`\`php
<?php
// tests/Unit/MyServiceTest.php

namespace App\Tests\Unit;

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class MyServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testShouldPerformExpectedOperation(): void
    {
        // Test implementation
        $this->assertEquals($expected, $actual);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Testing with Enums, DTOs, and Readonly Classes

1. **Enums**: When testing with PHP enums, always use the actual enum cases directly instead of mocking them:
    - ✅ DO: `$agent->method('getStatus')->willReturn(AgentStatus::Enabled);`
    - ❌ DON'T:
      ```php
      $status = $this->createMock(AgentStatus::class);
      $status->value = 'enabled';
      $agent->method('getStatus')->willReturn($status);
      ```

   When making assertions involving enums, always compare against the enum case directly rather than its string or numeric value:
    - ✅ DO: `$this->assertEquals(AgentStatus::Enabled, $agent->getStatus());`
    - ✅ DO: `$this->assertSame(AgentStatus::Enabled, $agent->getStatus());`
    - ❌ DON'T: `$this->assertEquals('enabled', $agent->getStatus()->value);`
   - ❌ DON'T: `$this->assertEquals(1, $agent->getStatus()->value);`

2. **DTOs**: When testing with DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), use the actual DTO classes rather than mocks:
    - ✅ DO: `$dto = new SomeResponseDto('value1', 'value2');`
    - ❌ DON'T: `$dto = $this->createMock(SomeResponseDto::class);`

3. **Readonly Classes**: Similar to DTOs, readonly classes should be instantiated directly in tests, not mocked:
    - ✅ DO: `$valueObject = new SomeValueObject('value1', 'value2');`
    - ❌ DON'T: `$valueObject = $this->createMock(SomeValueObject::class);`

Using real objects instead of mocks for these types provides several benefits:
- Tests more closely match real application behavior
- Eliminates subtle bugs caused by incomplete mocking
- Improves readability and maintainability of test code
- Reduces test fragility when refactoring these objects

Exception: Only mock these objects when absolutely necessary for specific test isolation requirements, and document the reason in a comment.


### Common PHPUnit Assertions
- `$this->assertTrue($condition)`
- `$this->assertEquals($expected, $actual)`
- `$this->assertStringContainsString($needle, $haystack)`
- `$this->assertCount($expectedCount, $array)`
- `$this->assertInstanceOf($expected, $actual)`

### Common Jest Matchers
- `expect(actual).toBe(expected)`
- `expect(actual).toEqual(expected)`
- `expect(string).toContain(substring)`
- `expect(array).toHaveLength(number)`
- `expect(promise).resolves.toBe(expected)`

### General Code Practices with Enums

1. **Enum Comparisons in Source Code**: When comparing or asserting enum values in source code (not just tests), always compare against the enum case directly:
    - ✅ DO: `if ($status === AgentStatus::Enabled) { ... }`
    - ❌ DON'T: `if ($status->value === 'enabled') { ... }`
    - ✅ DO: `return $status === AgentStatus::Disabled;`
    - ❌ DON'T: `return $status->value === 0;`

2. **Using Enums in Match Expressions**: Prefer using match expressions with enum cases:
    - ✅ DO:
      \`\`\`php
      $result = match($status) {
          AgentStatus::Enabled => 'active',
          AgentStatus::Disabled => 'inactive',
          default => 'unknown'
      };
      \`\`\`
    - ❌ DON'T:
      \`\`\`php
      $result = match($status->value) {
          'enabled' => 'active',
          'disabled' => 'inactive',
          default => 'unknown'
      };
      \`\`\`

Using enum cases directly rather than their values provides type safety, better refactoring support, and clearer code intent. It also prevents issues if the string or numeric representation of an enum changes.

This document outlines the development guidelines specific to the control application component of the DevHelm project.

## Code Organization

### Namespace Guidelines

Namespaces must describe the domain aspect of the code, not just technical implementation details. This ensures better organization and maintainability.

**Good examples:**
- `DevHelm\Control\Ticket\*` - for ticket/task related functionality
- `DevHelm\Control\Agent\*` - for agent-related functionality
- `DevHelm\Control\User\*` - for user-related functionality
- `DevHelm\Control\Security\*` - for security-related functionality

**Avoid generic namespaces:**
- `DevHelm\Control\Interfaces\*` - too generic, doesn't indicate domain
- `DevHelm\Control\Services\*` - too generic, classes should be grouped by domain
- `DevHelm\Control\ValueObjects\*` - too generic, classes should be grouped by domain
- `DevHelm\Control\Helpers\*` - too generic, doesn't indicate purpose
- `DevHelm\Control\Utils\*` - too generic, doesn't indicate domain

**Domain-based grouping rule:**
All classes should be grouped by their domain aspect, not by technical implementation pattern. For example:
- `ApiKeyGenerator` belongs in `Security\*` (domain: security/authentication)
- `JiraProvider` belongs in `Ticket\*` (domain: ticket management)
- `Ticket` value object belongs in `Ticket\*` (domain: ticket management)
- `UserManager` belongs in `User\*` (domain: user management)

**Namespace structure conventions:**
- Use domain-specific names for interfaces: `Ticket\ProviderInterface` instead of `Interfaces\TicketProviderInterface`
- Group all functionality by domain first, then by type if needed within the domain
- Avoid ALL technical implementation namespaces like `Services`, `Managers`, `Handlers`, `ValueObjects`, `Entities`
- Every class, regardless of implementation pattern (service, value object, entity, etc.), should be grouped by its business domain

### Factory Guidelines

Factories should be merged when they serve the same domain concept. For example, `AgentFactory` should handle both entity creation and DTO creation for agents rather than having separate factories.

### Exception Handling

- Symfony interfaces should throw Symfony exceptions
- DevHelm domain code should throw DevHelm exceptions when appropriate
- Do not create custom exceptions unless there's a clear domain-specific need
